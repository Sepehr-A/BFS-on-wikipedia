# BFS-on-wikipedia
It's a really simple task but I liked it since I had fun doing it <br>
So the task is:<br>
find the minimum number of clicks to go from http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birra to http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrolio browsing only within http://it.wikipedia.org
<br>
I used BFS for finding the minimum number clicks
